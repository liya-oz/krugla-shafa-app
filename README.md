## **📌 Overview**  

Krugla Shafa App is a **modern, user-friendly e-commerce platform** specializing in **handmade furniture**. Unlike mass-produced furniture, our philosophy is:

Our platform allows users to **browse** ready-made collections, **request custom furniture**, and **seamlessly shop online**.
